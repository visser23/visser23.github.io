    <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
    <p><strong>Last Updated:</strong> March 2025</p>
    
    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>Emoji Sticker Book ("the App") is a free mobile game designed for children ages 2-4. This privacy policy explains how the App handles user data.</p>
    
    <h2>Data Collection</h2>
    <p>The App does not collect, store, or share any personal data. All game-related information is stored locally on the user's device and is not transmitted elsewhere.</p>
    
    <h2>Internet & API Connections</h2>
    <p>The App does not connect to the internet, does not use external APIs, and does not transmit any data to third-party services.</p>
    
    <h2>Cookies & Tracking</h2>
    <p>The App does not use cookies or any form of tracking technology. It only retains temporary session memory for gameplay purposes, which is erased when the app is closed.</p>
    
    <h2>Security</h2>
    <p>Since the App does not transmit data over the internet or collect personal information, there is no risk of external data breaches.</p>
    
    <h2>Children’s Privacy</h2>
    <p>Emoji Sticker Book is designed for young children and does not collect any personal data. It is compliant with COPPA (Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act) standards.</p>
    
    <h2>Changes to This Policy</h2>
    <p>Any updates to this policy will be reflected on this page. Since no data is collected, changes will typically be minimal.</p>
